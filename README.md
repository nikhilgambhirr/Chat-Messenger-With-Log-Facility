# Chat-Messenger-With-Log-Facility

ðŸ”— Project Overview

     â€¢ This project is a Java-based peer-to-peer chat application that enables real-time text-based communication between users using Java Socket Programming.

     â€¢ Along with providing basic chat functionality, it also maintains a log file that records all conversation details in a periodic fashion for future reference.

     â€¢ The application is platform and architecture independent, running on any system with a Java Runtime Environment (JRE).

ðŸ”— Key Features

    â€¢ Peer-to-Peer Communication

        Â°Uses Java sockets for direct communication between clients.

  â€¢ Real-Time Chat

     Â° Enables instant text-based messaging between connected peers.

  â€¢ Chat Log Maintenance

     Â° Logs all chat history with timestamps into a file.

     Â° Provides periodic logging for organized record-keeping.

  â€¢ Cross-Platform

     Â° Runs seamlessly across different operating systems and architectures.

  â€¢ Lightweight & Extensible

    Â° Can be extended to support group chat, file sharing,Â orÂ encryption.

ðŸ”— Learning Outcomes

    â€¢ Practical knowledge of Java Socket Programming (TCP/IP).
     
    â€¢ Hands-on experience with network programming concepts (client-server, peer-to-peer).
     
    â€¢ Implementation of logging mechanisms in applications.
     
    â€¢ Understanding of platform-independent communication in Java.
     
    â€¢ Foundation for building scalable chat/messagingÂ applications.
